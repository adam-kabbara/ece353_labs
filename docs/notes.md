Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled. Other languages typically have their own tools that serve a similar purpose as Make. Make can also be used beyond compilation too, when you need a series of instructions to run depending on what files have changed. This tutorial will focus on the C/C++ compilation use case.

The make file is always named `Makefile` or `makefile`. It is a text file that contains rules. Each rule consists of three parts: a target, prerequisites, and a command. The target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files (.o files). The prerequisites are files that are used as input to create the target (like .c and .h files). A command is an action that make carries out (like running gcc or g++). Commands must be preceded by a tab character.
Here is an outline of a simple Makefile:

```Makefile
target1: prerequisites
	command
	command
target2: prerequisites
    command
    command
```
Example for a simple C program:

Makefile echoes each command before executing it. Make executes every specified target-rule in the file. If no target-rule specified, make executes the first target in the file.
